    content: `In the last few years, smartphones have gotten exponentially better. Taking a good photograph is no longer a labour intensive process, as everything you need is available in one small device. Most of the competing players in the field are constantly levelling up with advanced camera features, lenses, resolution and editing options. If you are wondering how to level up your own photography game and click photos like a pro with your mobile phone, then you are in the right place!

Did you know that currently most of the photos in the world are taken on a mobile device? But guess we all know that not all photos are good because it's not always about point and shoot. So, we have curated the best tips on how to take good photos with mobile phones. Check out how to master the mobile photography game.


&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Explore Your Camera’s Potential

Smartphones today are capable of things unimaginable. Often we are unfamiliar with it. We use the basic features and believe that’s all. But most phones have functions which can be manually controlled and adjusted for that perfect shot!

Explore these features and see how your phone performs to it. These features may include HDR (High Dynamic Range), exposure adjustment, burst photo mode, portrait mode, slow motion, editing options, white balance, shutter speed among others.

Analyse the auto mode to see how your phone focuses, so you are in control of the picture afterwards. It doesn’t matter which phone you use, every smartphone today is capable of producing good photos, and if you couple it with some of the brilliant tricks mentioned below, you are already on the path of becoming a pro. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Use Grids for Photo Composition

Although, framing your pictures depends on your artistic vision, try to make the most of what your phone can offer. Start applying the rule of thirds, it will give your picture that extra edge. Most smartphones today have grids which can be turned on to overlay on your phone camera screen. The grids simply help you to perfectly compose your picture by aligning the right objects at the right spaces, to make it visually appealing.

![Grids on a mobile phone help in Photo Composition. Photo by Emelina Forsberg. Glostars Photographer.](https://glostars.blob.core.windows.net/blog-photos-1/Blog1_Photo1_Grid.jpg)

*Grids on a mobile phone help in Photo Composition. Photo by Emelina Forsberg. Camera: Nikon D750 ISO 160 1/160 sek. f/1, 8 50mm* 

The grid breaks down your picture into nine segments. Use it to place your subjects on the corners of these segments where the lines meet, instead of the centre. This gives a natural look to your image which is soothing to the eye. If you are taking a landscape picture, the grid also helps you to keep your horizons aligned. An overly symmetric picture often looks manufactured, but remember rules are meant to be broken. So use your artistic eye to create that symmetry which best justifies your creative vision.


&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Use Leading Lines for Depth & Dimension

Leading lines are the most important element of any good picture. Although they are not apparent directly, they exist. It is created with the presence of any structure natural or implied, that provides a guiding line of vision for the viewer. For example, it can be created with shapes, light, shadows, rivers, roads, shoreline, footprints among others. They are usually vertical, horizontal and diagonal and each of the types impart different dynamics to the image. 

![Bridge railings creating structural leading lines add a guiding line of vision. Photo by Emelina Forsberg. Glostars Photographer.](https://glostars.blob.core.windows.net/blog-photos-1/Blog1_3%20Bridge.jpg)

When clicking any picture, just be aware of the presence of leading lines as they provide a compositional advantage. It helps in guiding the viewer's attention towards the main subject of the image. Additionally, it creates a sense of depth and dimension to your picture which adds to its visual appeal. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Use Natural Light for Perfect Picture

Digital flash is a trend of the past. Not only is it non-flattering but creates a harsh picture with rough lines.

The most visually appealing pictures are the ones which are taken in natural light. So, before you jump into planning how to artificially create light for your photos, try looking for sources of natural light. Maybe beside the window, indoor light, time of dusk or dawn, or candles for an artistic feel.

Different sources of light allow you to experiment with your creativity and get the perfect shot. Just make sure there is enough light on your subject for a close shot or you can manually adjust the exposure on your phone for that perfect balance of light and darkness.

![Natural light from the setting sun helps in taking an artistic shot. Photo by Emelina Forsberg. Glostars Photographer.](https://glostars.blob.core.windows.net/blog-photos-1/Blog1_4%20Light.jpg)

*Natural light from the setting sun helps in taking an artistic shot. Photo by Emelina Forsberg. Camera: Nikon D750 ISO 640 1/125 sek. f/3,5 24mm* 

Use flash in well lit spaces when absolutely necessary. It helps soften some dark shadows around the subject. Think of product or tabletop photography, using a flash may help hide some contrasting lines and enhance the image.


&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Manually Experiment with Exposure

Phone cameras today allow decent levels of manual control. You longer have to fret over an imbalanced picture with odd levels of brightness and darkness. Just tap on the camera view on the object or place you want to focus on and increase or decrease the exposure to adjust the brightness. Experiment with this feature a few times and you’ll soon learn the art of mastering a perfectly balanced shot. 

![Balancing exposure adjusts the level of brightness & darkness created by sun & shadows. Photo by Emelina Forsberg. Glostars Photographer.](https://glostars.blob.core.windows.net/blog-photos-1/Blog1_5%20Exposure.jpg)

*Balancing exposure adjusts the level of brightness & darkness created by sun & shadows. Photo by Emelina Forsberg. Camera: Samsung Galaxy S8* 

This feature helps to ensure that the most important parts of your picture are exposed perfectly in the frame with the right amount of colour and detailing. You can deliberately choose to over expose or under expose your pictures based on your creative vision.

For example, for artsy creations, fancy portraits or silhouettes you can reduce the exposure. Alternatively, for bright white facades or closeups you can over expose the colours. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;
### HDR for Mobile Photography

Often phone camera lenses cannot perfectly balance the exposure in a high contrasting setting. For example in outdoor landscapes with a dark foreground and bright sky. In most cases, a picture turns out either too bright or too dark. In order to capture the perfect shot in this case, make the best use of your camera’s features.

*HDR helps in capturing a perfectly balanced photo of a sunlight landscape with all the details. Photo by Emelina Forsberg. Camera: Samsung Galaxy S8* 

If your camera supports HDR, start using it. HDR refers to High Dynamic Range. This feature helps you to capture a balanced and perfectly lit photo with the right amount of exposure capturing all the details. Explore this feature on your next outdoor trip and share your creations with our photolovers community on Glostars.


&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Switch From Zooming to Close-ups

It's no longer a secret that digital zoom creates unappealing pictures with reduced image resolution. It increases the pixels while magnifying the image and lowers the picture quality. So, it’s time we start avoiding zoom and just move closer to our subjects. 

![Closeup shots of the flower adds a different dynamic to the picture. Photo by Emelina Forsberg. Glostars Photographer.](https://glostars.blob.core.windows.net/blog-photos-1/Blog1_7%20Flowers.jpg)

*Closeup shots of the flower adds a different dynamic to the picture. Photo by Emelina Forsberg.* 

Close-ups deliver a different dynamic to your picture and makes it interesting because each element is visible clearly. Additionally, it helps to avoid distractions and builds the focus towards the main subject of the image.

Try filling your entire frame with a close up shot of one subject and see the difference. The small image sensors of your phone camera supports this fashion of photography which creates an interesting perspective. Alternatively, try using optical zoom if you have the feature on your phone. It is quite popular among photographers today as it does not affect the photo quality.


&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Experiment with Different Perspectives & Patterns

Are you always wondering how to take pictures like photographers? What is their secret?

Well, apart from being a pro in their field, they are experts at experimenting. They explore their creative vision in the most unique way possible for that master shot. So let your creative juices flow and try to capture the pictures which showcases different patterns and perspectives. Check out the Glostars feed and Contest gallery for some inspiration, too.

*Path under the bridge with reflection on water and pillars for leading lines makes it a creative image. Photo by Emelina Forsberg.* 

Try looking for repetitive patterns, work on different angles, make your foreground subjects appear larger, get real close to the subject, capture a frame within your photo, shoot through layers, add empty or negative space, eliminate distracting elements, play with light, shadows or reflections.

There are several methods to experiment with. Be unconventional, start exploring and find your unique style.

&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Learn to Click Action Shots

Capturing the picture of moving objects is not easy. You might have tried several times, but the result is either blurry or out of focus. In such cases use your phone camera to your advantage. If your camera supports burst mode, this is exactly you need! You no longer need to worry about clicking at the right moment, because your camera’s shutter speed will take care of it. 

Burst mode is ideal for shooting subjects in action. Like a dance performance, waves splashing against the shore, babies, pets, flying objects among others. The burst feature captures a series of images in rapid succession but it creates a crisp and sharp picture every time. Just remember to use it where there is plenty of light for high-quality pictures.


&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Bonus Photography Tips 101

Your smartphone can click pictures almost as good as a digital camera. However, there are some basic rules apart from the tips which you must keep in mind. Before capturing any image prepare to keep your phone steady. Use a tripod or gimbal if you need orelse a shaky hand will result in blurry photos. Especially, for night or low light photography when the camera increases the ISO you must support it with a steady hand.

Additionally, focus on your subject manually to enhance the crispness in the picture. If it doesn’t turn out as expected, do not shy away from editing the photo. Your phone camera comes with inbuilt features unlike your digital camera, so make the most of it.

You can also use external editing apps or directly edit the picture on Glostars Android app before uploading. A little edit goes a long way and gives your picture that extra edge which makes the entire mobile photography experience worthwhile!

Also practice, practice, practice and share your creations on Glostars today!

Preface. What makes Glostars special is the Community.

Today we’d like you to meet one of our wonderful and very supportive community members - José Luis Asensio Fierro from Spain. Recently we had an exciting interview with José, and without any word to change, we’d like to share it with you. José, muchas gracias!

And you, dear reader, we wish you a pleasant reading and creative insights along the way of photography art. Create and inspire with Glostars!

***Interviewer: For how long have you been into photography?***

***José:*** I've been in photography since I was young. Back in 1970 I bought my first reflex camera, a Zenit. I was impressed. Despite being an inexpensive camera, it took photos more than satisfactory for my claims. It had many limitations, but for a 16-year-old it was something, he would never have dreamed of.

Then after a few years, I bought a Pentax. That was a leap in quality, for example, with focus options that the Zenit did not have, better optics and, in general, a construction that had nothing to do with the first camera.

With both gadgets I did what I considered good photos and I was happy.

Then it was time to work and I gave up this great hobby, until a few years ago when I went back to doing photography, but with a mobile phone. I had seen articles by professionals who were doing this type of photography, photos of magazine covers made with mobiles, and the question I asked myself was: “If they do it, why shouldn't I be able to do it myself, logically saving the distance?”

Thus, in 2015 I decided to resume my hobby, but not with a DSLR camera, being aware that I would never reach the same level of quality, but at the same time convinced that I could have good results. And here I am now.

***Interviewer: As a photographer, what challenges do you face?***

***José:*** First, I would like to make a small distinction. I think the word “photographer” applied to me is too big. The Royal Spanish Academy defines “a photographer” as "person who takes photographs, especially as a professional activity". That is where I must differentiate.

I can apply the first part of the definition, but the second part is the one that is huge and far away from me. I am not a professional photographer and therefore, answering your question, the challenges I face are enormous.

![Sunset taken with OnePlus, in Automatic Mode, resulting in a photo with ISO 100 and an exposure time of 1/640s. Photo by José Luis Asensio Fierro.](https://glostars.blob.core.windows.net/blog-photos-2/Blog2_1_sunset_by_jose.jpg)

*“Every summer I go to a coastal town where you can see beautiful scenes. This is one of them, taken with my OnePlus, in Automatic Mode, resulting in a photo with ISO 100 and an exposure time of 1/640s”. Photo by José Luis Asensio Fierro*

I read and see a lot of photography articles, and I must admit that this has helped me a lot. I had to relearn the concepts that accompany photography and it had rusted a bit. ISO, aperture, depth of field, exposure time, histogram, exposure triangle, rule of thirds, etc. They were the first challenges I had to face.

Overcoming those to the best possible extent, the rest of the challenges are already a consequence of my lack of professionalism. A good composition, that magical eye that watches and sees until you get that photo you dream of, fleeing from the topical and typical photos, are some of them that every time I go out to take a photograph, I burn them to try to get them and save them.

***Interviewer: What do you like about photography? Do you have any favorite style?***

***José:*** The truth is that I like everything. Just thinking that you can get at a certain moment an image of something that you will not be able to see again or capture it, this is something that fascinates me!

Yes, I have several favorite styles. For example, water, reflections, astrophotography, long exposure photography, sunsets or macro photography are some of them. These are some examples of those styles, all of them taken with different OnePlus mobile models.

*“Astrography is a passion of mine. I heard about the comet Neowise and taking advantage of the clear sky I climbed a mountain that we have nearby. Photo taken with my OnePlus 8 Pro, the Beastgrip mount and the tripod, I activated Professional Mode. After several tests, I decided to leave an ISO 800 and an exposure time of 30s.” Photo by José Luis Asensio Fierro*

***Interviewer: Do you have any formal photography training? Are you a pro?***

***José:*** As I mentioned before, the only training I have in the world of photography is self-taught.

I never did any photography courses. When I had the Zenit or the Pentax, I did everything from my own experience and with the help of my father. At that time, I did not have the Internet and everything I could do, in addition to the above, see one book or another.

Something totally different from what happened when I started my photography journey with mobile phones. There I already spent a lot of time reading photography articles that I found on the Internet, blogs and everything that fell into my hands. And recently, I have been reading a couple of books aimed exclusively at mobile photography.

As you can see and I told you, I am not a professional. A great fan, but only an amateur. 

***Interviewer: What has inspired you to get into photography?*** 

***José:*** My inspiration to get into photography was my father. Since I was a child, I saw him with his IKOFLEX.

He was really amazing. But taking pictures with his camera was not like today. I was not looking for the scene, I wasn't pressing the screen and then the shutter.

The focus system required great care. With a focus screen, still offering a clear view of the scene and using the focus magnifier, it was possible to ensure that it was more precise, reality appeared altered, as in a mirror.

And with no on-screen histogram, no parameter readers, IKOFLEX was accompanied by a Gossen Sixon photometer that my father was in love with. Unfortunately, I don't know what happened to the device, and God knows what I would like to have.

But all that does not end in searching the scene and pressing the shutter button. My father developed the photos himself at home, dated them and made the albums.

It is incredible to see the quality of the photos, the sharpness that he obtained with his camera, with results that, looking back, only allow me to say that this was an art. It was the art of photography and that marked my love of photography.

***Interviewer: What is inspiring you nowadays?***

***José:*** We all know that photography is light. And precisely these days, what inspires me the most are the Christmas decorations and their light.

These are moments that we can take advantage of to practice different techniques, trying to escape the characteristic photo, looking for compositions and playing with the lights. It is not easy, you must dedicate time and also, the delicate moments that we are living in. Do not facilitate the freedom of movement to be able to do it with ease and comfort.

![Long-exposure traffic photo taken at night by José Luis Asensio Fierro.](https://glostars.blob.core.windows.net/blog-photos-2/Blog2_3_long-exposure_by_jose.jpg)

*“I bought a neutral density filter, attached it as best I could to the protective case of the mobile, and I went on an adventure. One of the photos I got is the one shown, in Professional Mode of my OnePlus 6, with the Beastgrip mount and the tripod. Many tests and a satisfactory one with an ISO 100 and an exposure time of 10s.” Long-exposure photo by José Luis Asensio Fierro*

***Interviewer: What are the essentials that make someone a good photographer?***

***José:*** It's a difficult question, especially for someone like me who is not a pro.

Without wanting to be pretentious, I would say that if you were not born with the gift of being a photographer, the first thing is to have knowledge.

On the other hand, trying to get used to looking differently at the world around than we normally do, is essential. If we also try new things, break the rules at some point, make mistakes and try to differentiate ourselves from others, I think we can be on the right track to try to be a good photographer.

There are many more things, but I think that can be the beginning!

***Interviewer: What would you advise to photography beginners?***

***José:*** Perhaps this question can be answered without less shame than the previous one. I say this because I was a beginner and what I have learned is what I can advise from my own experience.

In addition to what I just said previously, first of all, I would dare to say that they should and we must bear in mind that there is no better camera than the one we carry with us. It is a well-known phrase, but it is not paid much attention to.

And I must insist on something that we have read many times. The first is that photography is light, and if there is no light there is no photography or there will be a bad picture. Something obvious but that we often forget.

It is also possible that we have also heard that "there is no worse photo than the one that is not taken" and another great phrase that does not stop accompanying me. Robert Capa said that "If your photos are not good, you have not gotten close enough." This is even more applicable to mobile photography, which has limitations that we all know.

When we assume the above, if we add knowledge of techniques, read all the articles or books that we can, do not be afraid when taking photographs, for example, in the streets.

![Butterfly perched on the glass of a house portal. Photo taken with OnePlus 6 in Macro Mode by José Luis Asensio Fierro.](https://glostars.blob.core.windows.net/blog-photos-2/Blog2_4_macro_by_jose.jpeg)

*“Macro photography is also one of my favorites. While on the street, I saw this butterfly perched on the glass of a house portal, and without thinking I took out my OnePlus 6 and did this in Macro Mode. The photo came out with an ISO 250 and an exposure time of 1/100s”. Photo by José Luis Asensio Fierro*

Practice, practice and practice. These are some of the tips that I allow myself to give to those who are new to the art of photography.

Oh, and I forgot one more thing. Let no one panic, but editing a photograph is not cheating. Unfortunately, a camera does not see things like a human eye and when editing a photo, the only thing we should try is to bring it as close as possible to what is remembered when it was done. The camera collects colors in a limited way. We are able to see all the nuances of the different colors, and therefore, editing a photograph is almost essential.

As I already told you, I am not a professional photographer and much less editing, I always use it to leave the photo in the most realistic way possible or the one I like the most.

***Interviewer: And the last question for today. How do you like Glostars?***

***José:*** The truth is that I was very surprised when I met Glostars. I have only participated in a couple of photography contests and Glostars gives the opportunity to do it simply and most importantly, transparently.

Let's say that I like the voting system more than that of a strict jury. At Glostars you submit to the judgment of the people who make up the Community, which means a greater number of "judges" and I think that can be more objective. If your photo is voted for by sixty or seventy people, for example, without knowing who the vote comes to, in my opinion, the winning photos have to be good.

The quality of the photos that enter each week in the contests is impressive and worth participating in. And not only because of the prizes, which are always an incentive especially with the good gifts Glostars offer, but with contests being weekly based, which motivates you to always be active.

The application is very easy to use, with regular updates that gradually improve the platform. I also appreciate the possibility to be in contact with a large number of photography amateurs and professionals who help you improve, give you ideas and support every day.

> ***Point of view*** *In a word, I consider it a great success and I encourage everyone who sees this little article to join the Glostars Community if they have not already done so.*

I want to end this interview by thanking the entire Glostars team for trusting me and naming me as a Brand Ambassador. It is an honor and a satisfaction that I thank from my heart for and I try to fulfill with the dedication and loyalty that it deserves. Thank you very much!

I think back to the beginning of the year 2020. When everything was as usual. Everyday life went on and life was as it always has been. Then it came, that thing that changed everything. At least for me.


&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Facing Real

When Corona began to appear in Sweden, it became more obvious and real. For me it was too much and I was so mentally affected that I had to go on a sick leave. I also live with a partner who belongs to the risk group, so it was the right and best decision to make.

![A dandelion during a wonderful sunset summer of 2019. Photo by Emelina Forsberg.](https://glostars.blob.core.windows.net/blog-photos-3/Blog3_1.jpg)

*A dandelion during a wonderful sunset summer of 2019. Photo by Emelina Forsberg. Camera: Nikon D750, Nikkor 50mm 1.8G, 1/200 sek, f/1,8, ISO100*  

At first it looked very gloomy. Being at home, without meeting people and family, being so limited
and not being able to do the things you used to do. I could not photograph events and concerts that I had done for the last seven years of my life. It really was a change.

Everything felt so uncertain and in the world everyone was affected in their own way. So you were one in the crowd of everyone who felt bad. At first I did not know how to handle the situation and felt very lost. Medicine and conversations with a therapist became the solution for the moment.

I thought everything would change. As motivation and inspiration were non-existent. My love and passion for photography had been involuntarily put on ice. I knew it was a part of me. So one day something happened. I needed to think of other thoughts. While life was wrapped up in a pandemic, the soul needed photography.

&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Strive for Change & Creation

I began to see the surroundings with new eyes. Simple little things suddenly became indescribably beautiful. Things you usually did not notice or take for granted were noticed through the camera. I began to strive to capture simple beauty. With the help of the light and my eye for image composition, I was able to create photographs that conveyed a feeling. A feeling that would make the spectator pause and really look.

When I was very limited, I had to take advantage of what was close to me. Which led to me finding objects that belonged to the every day. life With a lot of imagination and ideas that came to me, I created on a completely different level than before.

![When an idea comes to life and with a creative result. Photo by Emelina Forsberg.](https://glostars.blob.core.windows.net/blog-photos-3/Blog3_3.JPG)

*When an idea comes to life and with a creative result. Photo by Emelina Forsberg. Camera: Nikon D750, Nikkor 50mm 1.8G, 1/400 sek, f/2,2, ISO100* 

When I had bad days, I went to photography, which helped me. It became my therapy. Creating
with the camera made me think of other things and being creative made me feel better. 2020 was the year I have developed and really made me realize what I can and want with my
photography. Being out in nature has also helped me a lot. That's where I have been able to breathe out and just enjoy the moment.

Thanks to my sick leave, I have been able to test myself and let my creativity flow freely. This has led to me creating new contacts online, being able to inspire others and challenge myself more as a human being.

I have realized that you do not need much to succeed with a photograph. You can do so much with what you have at home or in your vicinity. 

(Next paragraph goes in italic and has a vertical line on a side)
It is important to test yourself and dare to move your body. You can capture moments in several different ways. With the help of light and a strong will, you can create something magical.

Share your story. Share your vision. Let’s make the best out of these days!

The art of photographing buildings and structures is known as architectural photography. It is meant to express the artistic stance of the architect. Similar to any other type or style of photography, with practice you will be able to master the art of architecture photography.

And to help you boost your skills, we’ve prepared an article to get you initiated into the world of capturing structures. Hope you get a new and fresh idea to tackle this photography style. So let’s start the journey into architecture photography!


&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Origins

This photography style originates alongside photography itself. The first permanent photograph taken in 1827, View from the Window at Le Gras by Nicéphore Niépce, just happens to also be the first architectural photograph.

Buildings and structures have been important photography subjects in history. Records of their design and practical use are proof of people’s appreciation of architecture. It was from the years of 1860s that the art of architectural photography started to establish among professionals.


&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Old vs Modern

Old architecture photography usually works best with a simple and direct composition. It is important to show natural beauty surrounding a building. The scenery in the environment can be included into a shot to allow it to give more context to the capture. It also helps to make it feel less confined.

Modern architecture photography, on the other hand, allows photographers to play with a more abstract style. You can choose to experiment with wide angle lenses to get special perspectives. Moving around and shooting from different angles will also help getting to the desired finish.

Besides, since modern buildings are often placed very close to each other, in some urban areas historical buildings look squeezed, and you can easily crop on the building without making a finished photo look unnatural.


&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Exterior vs Interior

Architectural photography involves capturing images from interior and exterior of buildings and structures. The techniques and equipment used in each type of photography are similar, but they still have some differences.

Exterior architectural photography shows outside faces of a building and its surrounding environment. This type of photography usually takes advantage of available light by day, which is naturally sunlight. By night, it can make use of street lights; moonlight, exterior building lights among other sources.

Landscape that surrounds a building is, in many cases, important to a general composition of a photograph. Some photographers actually consider the background environment as necessary to communicate to a viewer a harmonic relationship with itself and the building. It is currently a strong trend to use aerial drone photography to capture distinctive perspectives of structures and buildings.

Interior architecture photography requires lighting adjustments and specific positioning of objects to project a story to a viewer. It mainly focuses on colours, textures, objects and other elements in the structure’s environment.

A photographer has a goal of capturing the mood and essence of each subject within the frame space. Environmental light coming through windows and skylights is often used by professional and amateur photographers. Supplemental lighting is also applied to improve illumination in the scene.

Since in architectural photography the subjects usually do not move, it becomes easier to use photography editing tools to improve the balance of light in the shots.


&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Tips & Techniques

* Do a research of the building

Make sure to investigate the history and context of the site before you make your visit. This will help you focus on a specific story or idea to pursue and capture with your camera. Take your time: the building is not going anywhere anytime soon.

* Take photos in different weather conditions and times of the day

This can help you capture a more complete story of a building and its relations to the environment. Usually, some architects design buildings with hidden secrets that can only be found by looking at a structure from a certain side or during a specific time of the day.

* Use a wide angle lens

This will allow you to capture everything you need even in the tightest of spaces. A 17 to 40 mm wide angle lens is usually the favorite for professional architectural photographers.

* Consider the lighting

Lighting is a very important part of architecture photography. It is imperative to learn how to make good use of natural sunlight. Make sure you capture front or side lighting to the building. This can provide the right illumination and the chance to cast shadows across the face of the building. These shadows make the surface details more noticeable.

If you shoot buildings in a city, maybe you can wait for the night. Some of the buildings in the cities are lit by several lights giving the structure a sense of life and vibrancy. If you decide to take photos at night make sure to set your camera to a lower ISO setting to reduce digital noise. Also, a tripod can be very helpful for stability.

* Play with perspective

Take your time to find different angles that will give the building another level of beauty and appreciation. Try exploring all sides of the building or structure for exterior shots. Make sure 	your lines go precisely where you want them to go.

* Explore details

Paying attention and researching the details can reveal something new about the building’s history of construction that cannot easily be seen in a large one shot capture. Most people focus on capturing the building as a whole. But shooting from a macro level can open a lot of new possibilities.

* Revisit the site several times

Try returning to the site a time after you have made your captures. There is a chance you can get a different essence of the structure a time after you thought you took the perfect photo.

* Don’t be afraid of a human element

Using people in architectural photos is often an underutilised technique. Buildings are designed by and for people. So it will make a naturally interesting thing to include persons in your shots. Having people in the frame can help create a sense of scale and functionality of the buildings in the photos.


&nbsp;&nbsp;
### So...

Architectural photography can take many forms and has a lot to offer. From interior views to exterior captures, with the proper use of equipment and planning it is possible to generate the best photos. A lot can be done by using the right perspectives, angles, shapes and textures. All you need to do is let your imagination and senses make a snapshot.

Late December is a very anticipated timing for millions of people all over the world, as it is the best holiday season! With lovely snowfalls, shimmery lights, warm-hearting songs, presents and wishes to come true. It’s Christmas and New Year. Yay!

And as Glostars Team and Community are both genuinely international, we’ve decided to have a look at holiday traditions in different countries, in particular, Finland, Russia, Mexico and Sweden.
        
So let’s our holiday journey begin...


&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Christmas in Finland

Hyvää Joulua! That’s how Finns greet each other during the Christmas season.

There is a belief that Santa Claus lives in a Rovaniemi village in Finnish Lapland, Northern Finland. People from all over the world send letters to Santa, and he seems to be extremely busy fulfilling wishes of those! By the way, in Finnish language, Santa Claus is called “Joulupukki”, which is literally translated as "Christmas goat". Hm, interesting, right?

> ***Did you know?*** 
*There is a Christmas themed park called Christmas Land in the North of Finland near the place where it is believed Santa Claus lives.*
*What’s also curious about Finnish Christmas is that it is common for farmers to leave special food treats to birds and other forest animals during the season. That way even nature can have a little bit of Christmas spirit and little presents.*
*On Christmas Eve, it is common to have rice porridge for breakfast alongside with plum fruit juice. If a family has not yet got a Christmas tree by that moment, Christmas Eve is the perfect day to finally obtain and decorate one.*


![Beautifully decorated Christmas tree.](https://glostars.blob.core.windows.net/blog-photos-5/Blog5_1_pic1.JPG)

The day before Christmas is also a moment when a lot of people go to the graveyards to visit family. Families leave candles and lanterns around the graves of their relatives. At some point, a flickering field of candlelight illuminates the graveyard. Whereas, others, as it is a very common thing to do for Finns, prefer going to sauna during Christmas Eve.

Evening is the time for dinner. Nowadays it is common to have pork leg with mashed potatoes, casserole with different vegetables. Cured salmon and turkey are also gradually becoming a part of the menu. For dessert, Finns like sweet pastries, cakes and ginger bread and biscuits, as well as rice pudding. There is a very popular drink in Finland, also loved in other Nordic and Baltic countries - glögi, mulled wine mixed with spices such as cardamom and cinnamon. It is served hot with raisins and almonds.

Once the dinner is finished, Santa Claus often visits houses asking if there are children around. He then asks them if they have behaved properly during the year and after a positive answer, children get their presents.

During Christmas day, families in Finland prefer to enjoy the day at home. It is also quite common to see family with kids going outside for a walk or to ski in the forest, or if possible, a frozen river or lake.


&nbsp;&nbsp;
### New Year and Christmas in Russia

In Russia it is not very common to celebrate Christmas like in many other Christian countries. At the same time, celebrating New Year is by far more popular among Russians. Christmas is more of a religious occasion that is celebrated on January 7th.

On New Year Eve, Grandfather Frost aka Ded Moroz (in Russian) comes and brings presents to children. In fact, prior to his arrival children usually hold hands around the Christmas tree and call for him. Quite a funny thing to see how kids are trying hard to call Santa, thinking that as an old guy he is not supposed to hear well. Anyway, once he appears being accompanied by his granddaughter Snegurochka, children get their presents wishing each other: “S Novym Godom”, which stands for "Happy New Year" in Russian.

![Christmas presents ready to be opened.](https://glostars.blob.core.windows.net/blog-photos-5/Blog5_2_pic2.JPG)

> ***Did you know?*** 
*The difference in date of Christmas celebration happens due to the Russian Orthodox Church calendar. In majority, Russians use the Julian calendar for religious celebrations.*
*Traditional meals for Christmas are porridge made from wheat or rice called kutia, fruit, berries, walnuts and jellies. Some families eat porridge from a single bowl symbolizing unity. Some devout Christians decide not to eat any meat or fish during Christmas eve. Beetroot soup, vegan potluck, vegetable salads and other types of porridge are also very popular meals for Christmas eve. For Christmas Day, the meal involves pork and goose, dumplings and for dessert it is common to prepare fruit pies and gingerbread as well as honey bread cookies.*

In Russian, “Merry Christmas” is said as “S Rozhdestvom!”


&nbsp;&nbsp;
### New Year and Christmas in Mexico

In Mexico, Christmas and all holiday attributes are very loved. Partly, because Mexicans are well-known for being festive and happy people, and partly, because over 80% of the population identifies themselves as Christian Catholic. So, all in all, Christmas season is a big deal in Mexico.

The celebrations start on December 12th, on the day of the virgin of Guadalupe, and get to an end on January 6th, on the day of Epiphany. The parties during these days are called “posadas”.

In a posada, people usually gather with some friends, family, co-workers, or neighbors and  celebrate the holidays with dinner and drinks like “champurrado”, a chocolate-based thick beverage, fruit punch, and if there are children around, a piñata. It is very common to have a Mexican dish called “Tamales'' to eat during the posadas. Tamales are a traditional Mesoamerican dish made of corn dough filled with meat, cheese, fruits, vegetables, chilies, among other things. All Mexicans love them.

During Christmas Eve, on December 24th, families in Mexico gather for dinner, family talks and lovely time-spending with cousins, nephews, grandsons and other nearest and dearest. Mexican families can be very big sometimes. Traditionally for dinner there are meals like turkey, chicken, beans, salads, punch and wine. There is also a very popular dish called “menudo”, a soup made with cow’s stomach in broth with red chili pepper base, which is prepared in big quantities because it is supposed to last for a few days. In some parts of Mexico, at midnight of the 24th there is an exchange of Christmas presents.

During Christmas Day, almost everybody in Mexico gets to rest. Since it’s a public holiday, you cannot expect to have services available in the cities, so people decide to spend the day at home to enjoy their new presents. Some people gather again with their families to continue the celebration in a more relaxed way. It is common to continue eating the food that was prepared since the day before. This is called “recalentado”, literally re-warmed, and having this for breakfast is a tradition.

During New Year’s Eve, Mexicans join to celebrate just like any other festivity. For dinner the menu includes traditional Mexican food, fruit salads, chicken, turkey among many other things. It is a tradition to have a glass of wine ready and to toast for the New Year exactly at midnight. In the cities, there is usually a lot of fireworks through the night and even the days after.

On the first of January, Mexicans again come together to continue celebrations and eat “recalentado” from the previous night. There is nothing special to celebrate during the day, but since it is a public holiday, people spend the day with family and friends.

During Epiphany day, also known as “Día de los Reyes Magos” in Mexico, there is a special occasion in Mexico and many parts of Latin America. So yes, you can say that Christmas season in Mexico is all about food.

First Advent is when the holiday starts to be celebrated for real. When there are four Sundays left until Christmas Eve. Then you light the first candle of four, which is placed in a nicely decorated stake. Then you light another candle every Sunday until Christmas Eve.

When the first of December is here, the Christmas calendar begins to be broadcast on television, which can be watched by the whole family. The Christmas calendar is divided into 24 episodes, this has been a tradition since 1960. In addition to the Christmas calendar on TV, there is a radio calendar with the same concept, but on the radio. It is also common to have an Advent calendar where you can open 24 doors, one every day until Christmas Eve. The doors can contain everything from sweets to various items. This is popular with both children and adults.

Christmas music, Christmas baking, Christmas food tables and Christmas crafts are something you do daily during all these days until Christmas. Both at home and at school. Many people eat Christmas dinners with their colleagues at work, Christmas music is played everywhere, they bake with family and friends and do crafts and decorate. Everything to create the perfect Christmas feeling.

Christmas food is an important part of the celebration and you eat all of these throughout the month. Christmas ham, meatballs, ”lussekatter”, gingerbread, rice porridge, herring, Jansson's Temptation, prince sausages, beetroot salad, Christmas must and many more delicacies.

On December 13, Lucia is celebrated by having Lucia trains. At school, at work, in the church, in shops, nursing homes ... Almost everywhere. To spread Christmas spirit and light in the dark.

The Christmas tree has no specific day when you should decorate it. In the past, it was common to bring in a spruce and decorate it the day before Christmas Eve. Today, people do things differently and it is also very common to have an artificial spruce that you can then have for a longer period of time.

Christmas in Sweden is a lot about family, relatives and friends to gather and have fun. For some, it's even the only time of the year to meet. On the day before Christmas Eve, it is common to start gathering, so that you are all together already from Christmas Eve morning.

On Christmas Eve itself some people go to church to attend church services. This is not as common today. All homes have different traditions. What everyone does is give and receive Christmas presents, which you open together.

In some homes, Santa knocks the door and leaves a sack of Christmas presents. After eating a Christmas lunch together and opening Christmas presents, you sit together in front of the TV. At 15:00, Kalle Anka starts. This has been a Swedish tradition for many, many years. Then short clips from Kalle Anka and various miscellaneous Disney movies are shown. The evening is spent together, you often do quiet activities and just have fun.

The Christmas celebrations keep on going even on Christmas Day. People gather with friends and family, those not being met on Christmas Eve. Christmas Day is also the day when many so-called "returnees" go out and party, preferably with people you do not meet so often.

Celebration ends on January 13, when you dance out Christmas and take down the Christmas tree. Then it is common to do an event in smaller villages, where you gather and dance around the Christmas tree one last time.

So this is something about the celebration of winter holidays in Finland, Sweden, Russia and Mexico. And how do you spend holidays in your country? Spread the word and shake up the happiness by sharing your amazing photos from Christmas and New Year on Glostars.

Look forward to seeing you!

Hello there. My name is Emelina Forsberg. I'm a photographer and visual storyteller. Born and  raised in beautiful Dalarna County in Sweden. I like nature, coffee, winter, tv-shows, Harry Potter, magical things, crafts, animals and Christmas.

&nbsp;
## Developing as a photographer
        
I have always been an artist's soul and I thank my mother for that, who is an artist herself. My  interest in photography started about ten years ago and has only grown stronger since then. What is so fun about photography is that through my camera I can preserve emotions and moments forever as well as being creative. I love to find beauty in simple things and make art out of it. Photography is my art and therapy.
        
I'm also very versatile as I do many different kinds of photography. Over the years I've built up my experience with photographing concerts, events, portraits, weddings, business, maternity, products, landscape and loads of nature. What I love the most is to photograph in nature. I have a big love and passion for magical light and bokeh. I often look for the sunlight and use it in my photos.

As a photographer I sometimes face challenges, for example, when the weather is bad. Don't get me wrong, you can take awesome photos when it's raining. But it does make it harder and takes more time. There is also a lot of competition, and that makes it difficult to get people to actually see your photography work. Being a photographer can be expensive, if you want to develop. But what's great is that you can take amazing photos with just a mobile phone camera these days.

I studied media in senior high school, which involved photography. I got to learn the basics, mostly how to use an analog camera. A few years later I took a photography course and learned more about digital photography. I'm actually mostly self taught and it has taken many years to be the photographer I am today. I have many more things to learn and develop, which I'm so looking forward to doing.

*One of many concert photos taken by Emelina Forsberg during the years.*

I've always been creative and into art. I used to do a lot of writing before I realised I loved photography. I started to play around with my father’s mobile phone which had a camera and I fell in love with the progress. It was so much fun and I found a new way to use my creative side.

> ***Point of view***
*After so many years I feel that I need photography in my life. It inspires me to keep going and challenge myself. My eyes see art everywhere. Every day I see things and moments that I would love to capture. I often get new ideas and I just love being creative. It's wonderful to start from an idea and then see the finished result.*


&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Photography Advice

To be a photographer you have to have patience. A photo can look amazing in your head and then it turns out looking not what you imagined. I usually say that if you have an eye for image composition you can do pretty much anything in photography. A creative mind is the key.

* At the beginning of doing photography, it's good to take as many photos as you can.

* Keep trying and play around with different settings. Start with using the auto option, just to figure out how to actually photograph something.

* Don't be afraid to think outside the box. Take pictures from different angles and look around you. What environment are you in, make sure to see what's behind your object. It saves you time and it looks better.

* Move your body. Do not be afraid to actually use your body when doing photography. Get down on the ground, stand on rocks and even jump if you have to. Make sure to wear clothes based on the weather, it can actually disappoint you if you can't keep on because of being too cold or warm.
Always prepare with batteries and memory cards.

You will get better and see a difference every day if you keep trying!

### When in Glostars

I first noticed Glostars through Instagram, where the people behind the app were so nice. They thought that I would fit well on their platform. That got me really excited and I was so impressed by the work they had put into it. I got curious about the contests they had every week. So I decided to give it a go and uploaded one of my photos. And I won that contest, which made me so happy and even more motivated to keep using the app. Not just because of the winning part, but also because I started to really enjoy the Community.

Glostars users started to notice my photography work as I uploaded photos to my profile frequently and there were new contest themes every week that I was excited about. Each week I participated and also got the opportunity to have a good communication with the Glostars Team. Which led to being asked if I wanted to become an ambassador. That was such a confirmation of me doing something good as a photographer. I gladly said YES and a new phase began.

As an ambassador you had some tasks to do to help Glostars get even more noticed by people. I approached my followers on my social media and I saw that it worked, as there were photographers I knew who joined the Glostars app. I promoted the contests and talked well about them.

I got such wonderful feedback from the team of Glostars and that kept me motivated to keep going and I was also developing as a photographer during 2020. I think many people saw that in me and that I was a person who really made an effort to succeed.

So when I got an offer to join the actual team of Glostars I was so flattered and thankful as the team saw something in me, particularly that I can provide others with my knowledge as a photographer. I felt that joining the Glostars Team was something I wanted to do and it would help me grow even more as a visual content creator.

So now I'm a part of the Glostars Team and I couldn't be happier!

My role in the team deals with tasks that suit a photographer. I am about to provide my knowledge and experience, as well as help others through their journey of creativity. Can't wait to see what this will bring and I look forward to the upcoming year 2021.

Glostars is such an amazing app and Community. I've felt so welcomed, and the people behind it are so sweet and kind. I think it's awesome that all kinds of photographers are welcome to join with their photos. If you are new or pro, it doesn't matter.

It's also great that you can win prizes. This motivates people to publish their work even more. It's wonderful that users can be part of voting on what theme is next.
I love that we can positively impact the Community. For being new in the market, Glostars has accomplished something awesome. I like how Team wants to develop the app alongside with Community and make more features for users. I'm sure it is going to grow more and become very popular. I also look forward to what Glostars will come up with in the future!

As we have talked about this phenomenon previously in our sunset photography article (link to the article), a Golden Hour refers to the time during the day when the sun emits light that is predominantly enjoyable for people. There is no defined beginning or end to the golden hour. How long it lasts depends greatly on your location and the season of the year. Golden hour comes shortly after dawn on the east and before the dusk on the west.


&nbsp;&nbsp;
### How To Capture Golden Hour Shots
        
Take advantage of this magical moment! Go grab your camera or smartphone and start taking photos of whatever you want to capture. During this period, the sunlight emanates very softly and with very low intensity giving us the unique opportunity to capture very interesting scenarios.

![City during the golden hour.](https://glostars.blob.core.windows.net/blog-photos-7/Blog7_1_pic1.jpg)

*Photo by Norman Bronischewsky, Glostars Sunset Photography Contest Winner. City during the golden hour.*

Landscapes and portraits are some of the most photographed subjects during this time. Nevertheless, you shouldn’t limit yourself to one or two photography styles. There are almost endless possibilities to be explored during this period. The lower position of the sun in the sky makes it possible for the sun rays to cast large shadows and bring intensified effects on the surfaces’ characteristics.

There is no strict rule that says what techniques or kind of equipment you must use during the course of the golden hour. Firstly, as we always suggest, planning is important.

* The time period of a golden hour is quite limited so it is a good idea to have everything ready before starting shooting. Maybe you should explore a location in a previous date and find the best spots for photo shooting.

* If you want to capture landscapes, you have to consider any building, trees or mountains that could, at some point, block the natural sunlight to your scene.

* If your plan is to shoot portraits, your model should stand in a way that the sunlight hits its face. The difference with the light and shadows will produce a more dramatic effect on your subjects. Try experimenting around with different angles and directions. Different results obtained by this might surprise you!

Some photographers use the sun’s flare during sunrises and sunsets for their photos. You can try to manipulate it by experimenting with the direction of the camera relative to the sun's direction. Just tilt your camera a little in any direction and you will notice how a small movement will change the whole capture immensely.

>***Did you know?***
*Golden Hour photography is often something wedding photographers offer during the wedding day, and it’s very popular. And it’s understandable since the effect of golden hour makes a photo stand out.*

![Silhouette of a woman standing on the shore lit by golden rays of the sun.](https://glostars.blob.core.windows.net/blog-photos-7/Blog7_2_pic2.JPG)

*Photo by Irvan Junizar. Silhouette of a woman standing on the shore lit by golden rays of the sun. Glostars Sunset Photo Contest Third Place Winner*

Golden hour is the best time for creating silhouettes. It comes very easy just by letting natural light come through one side of your subject while letting very little from the other. Also, deep contrasts between light and shadows can make silhouettes look absolutely fantastic.


&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Best Camera Settings for Golden Hour Photoshoot

We recommend the following settings to fully take advantage of the Golden Hour:

* Shoot in Manual mode. Thus, it is easier to adjust the proper exposure and make good use of lighting.

* Try low apertures for portraits. For example, f/1.8 and f/2.8.

* For group photos try a narrower aperture.

* As the sun goes down, switch to aperture priority mode. This allows you to increase the ISO as you see fit.

* To balance the lighting on your scene, use a reflector.

* For landscape captures, a tripod is very useful.


Taking photos throughout the golden hour is a dynamic process. The lighting in the environment changes rapidly and continuously so you will have to check the settings and adjust them accordingly to always get the best results on your images.

The most essential thing you have to consider when shooting during the golden hour is to remember to have fun! It doesn’t really matter if you are a beginner or a professional photographer, the main idea is always to enjoy the process of taking photos while at the same time exploring and learning new methods and techniques.

Hopefully this article has improved your understanding of the Golden Hour. For more ideas on how to take the perfect photos make sure to [check our blog](https://glostars.com/blog).

Halloween’s festivities are just around the corner. And here at Glostars we would like to give you some tips and recommendations so you can take the most advantage of the season to get the most amazing images, and share them with our Community, of course. We’ll be excited to see the results of your hard yet creative work!

&nbsp;
### Origins of Halloween

But first, let's talk a little bit about history to get into the atmosphere of the celebration that, by the way, takes place on October 31st.

Halloween’s traditions come from Celtic festivals, with pagan roots, and became Christianized as Halloween. Nowadays Halloween is known and celebrated mostly in Western countries with their own unique variations. During this time, kids and adults go to the neighbor's house for trick-or-treating, being dressed in spooky costumes; carve pumpkins or other vegetables, watch horror films among other things.

On Halloween there is a tradition to carve pumpkins and make them lanterns. These are called jack-o'-lantern. This tradition actually comes from Ireland. It is very common to see these lanterns as home decorations and on doorsteps and yards.

>***Did you know?***
*This year’s (in 2020) Halloween will have a full moon. The last Halloween with a full moon happened 19 years ago.*

&nbsp;
### Tips for Halloween Photography

In order to create a scary and atmospheric photo for Halloween, you can experiment and follow some of the following advice that we’ve gathered for you:

* Use all the props you can find. There will be tons of decorations around during the celebration, so make sure to take advantage of them for your photos. Don’t forget to find or actually carve a pumpkin, prepare a costume, a broom or some other theme elements. Maybe even a black cat or a spider?

* If you want to have more fun turning into your photos, you should try other uncommon tools such as a smoke bomb. This one will help create a very unique environment in which each of your clicks will look mystic.

* Use silhouettes. With some costumes on, try capturing the golden hour (link to Golden Hour photography article) photos of silhouettes in contrast with the sunset light. Or if you prefer, wait until nighttime (night photography) to capture some spooky images with the moon in the background.

* If you want to create ghostly figures or silhouettes, you can try using thin white fabric.

* Think about what scares you and use that. This is the time to let your creativity explode and use your biggest fears to capture into photographs. Are you afraid of ghosts, witches, clowns, spiders? Why not combine all of them?

* Use your hometown’s history. Do some research about your hometown and its scary stories. Find the building, the alley, the park or any location that can add realism to the photography.

* If your city or town doesn’t have any creepy location, then try finding any abandoned place that can give the spooky mood into the scene.

* Use the Blue Hour for a more haunting effect.

* Adding motion blur into your photos can give an eerie effect on movement. Try experimenting with long exposures and moving subjects for this effect.

* Make your own unique jack-o'-lantern. Try carving a pumpkin or any other root vegetable into any figure that resembles a face or something related to Halloween. Introduce a candle and get into a dark room. Then make use of the shadows and silhouettes to capture cool images.

>***Did you know?***
*It is believed that the festivities that pre-dated Halloween originated around the year 4000 B.C. That would mean that Halloween has been celebrated for more than 6000 years.*

&nbsp;
### Best Camera Settings

Of course, as you experiment we can hardly suggest the best camera settings. However, we still do have some recommendations on camera settings for perfect Halloween captures.

Here they are:

* **ISO.** Try a large number to make sure you get the right sensitivity to low levels of light. With a higher ISO number you won’t need to reduce the shutter speed, but you risk getting noise in your captures.

* **Shutter speed.** For better results in Halloween photography try using slow shutter speed in low light environments. This effect will add spookiness from the darkness while making sure your image is properly exposed. Though if you do want to use a faster shutter speed you can use a flash, that creates cool effects, too. 

* **Exposure.** It is very important to get the right exposure while photographing in low lighting environments. We recommend using the metering tool that can be found in most modern cameras. 

* **Aperture.** For a nice Halloween portrait we recommend a wide aperture. This will allow your subject to be in focus while the background gets some ambient blurriness. It gets easier if you are able to turn the camera´s Auto Focus Lock (AF-L) on.

* **White balance.** Try playing with the white balance of your captures. For warmer pictures you can experiment with lower kelvin numbers. If you want your images lighting to look colder, then you can increase the kelvin number.

In other words, this is the exposure triangle you would like to consider so you can capture a genuine mood for this festivity.

* Increase ISO

* Slow shutter speed

* Large aperture

* **BONUS:** You can also use exposure bracketing to be secure that you will be getting the best results in your captures. By the way, exposure bracketing is a special technique during which, instead of taking one picture, a photographer takes 3 or more, so all of them are exposed a bit differently. For instance, usually one photo is correctly exposed, another one is slightly underexposed, while the third is, on contrary, slightly overexposed.

Hopefully this article has given you ideas on how to improve your captures of Halloween. For more ideas on how to take the perfect photos, [check other of our articles](https://glostars.com/blog).

There is no way to clarify when exactly the developments of photography began. But it is clear that since ancient times, humanity has been desperately looking for ways to capture images and scenes. At some point, humanity came with two very important discoveries: the camera obscura and the observation that there are certain substances that react easily to light.

A camera obscura, also known as pinhole imaging, is a projection of an image through a small opening onto an opposite surface. It is believed that this principle was known and used since ancient times.

Around the year 1021, an Arab physicist known as Alhazen, studied intensively and documented the concept of Camera Obscura. However, the oldest known description of pinhole imaging was made by Chinese philosopher Mozi who lived between 470 and 391 BC.

>***Did you know?***
*The coining of the word “photography” is attributed to Sir John Herschel in 1839. It comes from the Greek “photos”, meaning “light”, and “graphê”, meaning “drawing or writing”, therefore, photography simply means: “drawing with light”.*

&nbsp;
### First Permanent Photograph

It was until 1685 that the first transportable camera was envisioned. It was the work of Johan Zahn who had imagined a camera that was small and lightweight enough to be practical. Nevertheless, it was not possible to build until almost 150 later.

Joseph Nicéphore Niépce used a carriageable camera obscura to expose a pewter plate coated with bitumen to light, and then, he used it to create the first permanent photograph.

*View of the Boulevard du Temple, a daguerreotype made by Louis Daguerre in 1838, is considered to be the earliest photography to include people. The intention was to capture the boulevard, but two persons were on the street and got captured as well. Greatest photobomb in history.*

&nbsp;
### First Commercial Camera

Photography cameras were not publicly available until 1888. The first commercial camera was produced by the company Kodak Eastman. It was named ”Kodak” and it contained a roll of paper-based film containing 100 exposures. Once the roll was finished, the whole camera was sent to the factory in order for the film to be processed and the camera reloaded.

Instant cameras would not appear until after World War II. In 1948 Polaroid released the first instant camera. A secret chemical process was produced inside the camera to develop the film inside in less than one minute.

In 1977, the photography company Konica launched the first “point and shoot” compact camera. The camera had an automatic exposure system that selected the appropriate shutter speed.

>***Did you know?***
*Events of World War II (1939-1945) built a new style of photography. Photojournalists who were present during the war developed a new style of telling the truth to society.*

&nbsp;
### Digital Era

Even though the first digital camera was developed by Kodak in 1975, Nikon launched the Nikon F3, the first digital camera to reach the market in 1991. It was, however, equipped by Kodak with a 1.3 megapixel sensor and aimed purely for photojournalists.

A couple of years later, in 1994, Apple launched a digital camera directed at the consumer level market. It was the Apple QuickTake 100 camera and it was able to work from a home computer using a serial cable. It was quickly followed by other companies such as Kodak, Casio and Sony with their own digital cameras.

In 1999, five years later, the Kyocera Visual Phone VP-210 was launched in Japan. This mobile phone had a 0.11 Megapixel camera built-in and it could take up to 20 pictures. Making it effectively the first camera phone.

>***Did you know?***
*A camera commonly recognised as the first digital one was actually a prototype developed in 1975 by an engineer at Kodak named Steven Sasson. The weight of the camera was almost 4 Kg. It was capable of taking monochrome pictures. However, to be able to see the images, a special screen had to be developed.*

&nbsp;
### Glostars Community

In 2020 a group of awesome people launched the renewed version of Glostars, a social platform specialized for photographers and visual artists allowing them to freely submit and share their works and get recognition by other members of the community.

 Many great photos can originate at nighttime. However, this type of photography can be a real challenge for beginners. So here is an article to provide you some fascinating insights about  night photography. Hopefully, it helps embrace night camerawork and improve your results while having fun capturing the world around.

A few common subjects of night photography include celestial objects, thunderstorms, city lights, skylines, industrial areas, nature, fireworks, auroras, among many more.

&nbsp;
### Summary

Night photography stands as a prime focus of some photographers. There are so many things that can only be produced during the night. A primary subject, buildings or architecture in general, are used just like in normal daytime photography. But by night, everything changes and the experiences shown through the lenses can be unique and magnificent.

There are a few things that you must consider before engaging with night photography. The gear we recommend is a tripod, a shutter release, a timer, or if possible, a smartphone with night photography mode.       

![Night capture of Cathedral Of Santa Maria Del Fiore. Florence, Italy.](https://glostars.blob.core.windows.net/blog-photos-10/Blog10_1_pic1.jpg)

Some ideas that can be applied specially during the night are to contrast light and darkness. During this time, effects on reflections are quite unique. It is also possible to experiment with lights and make use of the moon as a subject or focal point.

Just like any other type of photography, during the night you can try testing diverse settings on ISO, aperture and shutter speeds. After all, this is all about experimenting and discovering new forms of arts.

&nbsp;
### Tips & Techniques

Enjoy some practices and equipment recommendations that we suggest during night photography sessions:

* Use a tripod for long exposure snaps. If there is no tripod available, place your camera on a steady table or chair.

* Use manual focus for conditions with low light. Digital cameras, especially the newer models, include a live view mode which favors precise manual focusing.

* A shutter release cable or self timer should be used to avoid camera shake.

* A camera lens with a wide aperture, preferably one with spherical elements to reduce imperfections.

* A stopwatch or remote timer would be very useful for very long exposures.

* A smartphone with a night photography model makes your life way easier.

To get perfect night photos, we recommend shooting in RAW format. Most cameras generate RAW files with a higher range of obtainable colors and more fluid transitions. At night, your photographs will likely contain a big dark section. RAW is the best option to avoid grainy images due to low levels of light.

&nbsp;
### Ideas

Have some ideas in mind and create the best night photos!

#### Try experimenting with reflections
Reflections are more difficult to capture during the day since they are reliant on the light in a scene. You will only need to consider artificial light once the natural light is gone.

Don't forget to use as much color as possible. Colors blend in the reflections on the water and generate a contrast between smooth and sharp.

#### Drawing with light

Use long exposures to capture figures of light, once the right material is in use. An example can be, when snapping a subject try switching the exposure to manual and choosing the bulb setting on the camera. After that, trip the shutter and shoot your subject moving a flash in different patterns. Any type of small light can do the job.

You can try experimenting with this method to generate different results. Don’t be scared of doing it several times. Sometimes it takes several attempts to reach the desired results.

![Fascinating long exposure night photography example.](https://glostars.blob.core.windows.net/blog-photos-10/Blog10_2_pic2.jpg)

Good idea would be to use a variety of light sources. Think about simple flashlights or specialized devices such as supplementary light sources including candles, matches, sparklers, and fireworks, among others.

#### Consider the moon

Moon is one persistent light source at night. You may use it as a focal subject or just as a part of a background, so it creates some impressive effects for nighttime photos.

#### If not the moon, what about a star?

If you choose a smaller aperture you will be able to capture “starlight”. Yes that’s right, when the aperture hole is small enough, incoming light is affected by an optical phenomena that creates beautiful star shapes. You can use this during night photography sessions in the city streets and having street lights in your photo.

#### Play with different shutter speeds

Try swapping to shutter priority if you want to snap moving objects. You must select the shutter speed, and the camera then selects the proper aperture. This method aids you capture exciting light lines and sceneries at night.

Try to produce enough test shots until you obtain the desired effect. To capture colorful paths, adjust your camera to a low shutter speed; let's say from 1/30 to 30 seconds. The slower the shutter speed you choose, the lengthier the light paths will be captured. Just as experimenting with diverse shutter speeds, do the same with ISO levels and apertures.

&nbsp;
### So...

Night photography can be a lot of fun to experience once the basics behind it are clear and understood. You can play with exposure settings and generate different combos of shutter speed, ISO, aperture, thus get very interesting captures.

Feel free to use different light sources, explore new compositions and manage your subjects. It is important to make sure you have a steady camera and aim for long exposure shots. Once you have mastered all of this, you will be taking the most amazing night images.

Fingers crossed, this article enhanced your understanding of night photography. For more ideas about photography in general, make sure to join our global Glostars community platform.

The art of photographing a person, or a group of people, is known as portrait photography. The main goal of this photography type is to capture not only the image, but also the personality of the subject. This can be achieved by using effective lighting, backdrops and poses. There are different uses of portraits, from personal to professional display.

In 1838 the first portrait photograph was taken. A funny thing is that it was actually an accident. Louis Daguerre intended to capture the view of the Boulevard du Temple with his camera. However, there were two people on the street who got captured in the image. Are you able to spot them by the sidewalk on the left?

![Boulevard du Temple by Louis Daguerre, 1938.](https://glostars.blob.core.windows.net/blog-photos-11/Blog11_1_pic1.jpg)

Since then, people have been one of the major subjects of photography. There are many styles of photography involving people and because of the development of digital photography and the Internet, individuals from all over the world have taken more photos involving other people than ever before in history.

>***Did you know?***
*Dead people used to be one of the most popular subjects of portrait photography during the 1800s. Many families at the time saw this type of photography as a way to document the memory and appearance of their loved ones.*

&nbsp;
### Tips to master portrait photography

Just like taking the perfect photo, here are some tips for you to take the perfect portrait image.

* Preparation is key. Spending a proper amount of time for preparations is essential for portrait photography.

* Make sure to watch and understand lots of people. Observe persons from different perspectives and light conditions. While doing this, evaluate what kind of angles and lighting will be the most successful for each specific individual.

* It is important that the model feels comfortable and understands the photographer’s approach for the shot. The model should know exactly, or at least have an idea, what type of captures you are looking for.

* Give enough freedom to the model to move and pose. That can help you capture their natural inner beauty and charm.

* In order to achieve the previously mentioned state, it is recommended to talk to the models during the photoshoot. Asking them questions, making them laugh and smile will make everything easier for them, especially if they have never been in a photoshoot before.

* The most beautiful pictures are the ones where the model is not looking directly at the camera. So as a photographer, try capturing a spontaneous moment when it appears.

* Try developing your own unique style. Check the works of other professionals and visit different museums to look for a source of inspiration and stimulus.

* Pay close attention to details. Portraits are not just photos of people. There can be something in the scene that catches your eye for any reason. Try finding something that your subject can interact with. This can bring a new valuable detail to the capture.

* Use low ISO, something between 100-400. Try higher numbers if you require a faster shutter speed. Try aperture on f/2 and f/4 for single subject or f/5 and f/8 for groups.

* Remember to have the proper equipment available. Use a tripod if you need to keep your camera steady and a remote if you need to take some distance away from it.

I always learn and understand things either by seeing or imagining them in my mind. Funny part - it took me over two decades to realise it. But once I did, it all started to make sense: why and how I can visualize and build scenarios in my brain with every tiny detail beautifully defined.

&nbsp;
### Mobile photography fan

Probably that was the reason why I was good at photography (although self-proclaimed) from my early twenties when I got my first smartphone with a camera. Since then I never stopped clicking the world around. Surprisingly, although I expanded my set of gadgets with a fancy DSLR aka digital single-lens reflex camera, I always came back to mobile photography and sold my once dreamt of DSLR at a fairly low price. 

My mobile photography journey started with my overseas studies to India. To mention, originally I come from the capital of Bangladesh, Dhaka. New culture, different landscapes, historical sites - they were all perfect for me to unconsciously fall in love with photography, or to be more precise, Mobile Photography.

*Taken at a peaceful moment on lake Saimaa, Lappeenranta. Experimenting with mobile photography. Photo by Sajib Saha*

During three years of my stay in India, I have captured some 12 GB of photos and videos, all with mobiles. And after my graduation I went back to my home country, where I was working on a start-up for 3 years before coming to Finland, Glostars country of origin to be.

&nbsp;
### When in Finland

One of my main reasons for coming to Finland was a desire to explore Europe. Frankly saying, I hardly miss a chance when it comes to travelling and getting to know different countries and cultures.

So far I have been to 10 countries in Europe and, sadly, don’t remember most of the names of sights and attractions I’ve visited. However, I surely remember most special photos taken in those places.

![TMarvelous architectural construction in the Indian city of Agra.](https://glostars.blob.core.windows.net/blog-photos-12/Blog12_2_pic2.jpg)

*Marvelous architectural construction in the Indian city of Agra. Photo taken by Sajib Saha*

One of the greatest moments in my life that happened in Finland is co-founding Glostars Oy and working with passionate individuals.

Each team member has true admiration and interest in visual content creation - photos and videos, as well as authentic creators behind them. And as a team we are fascinated to see amazing moments captured in frames coming from different corners of the world by creators with pro gadgets or with their smartphones.  

>***Point of view***
*For me photography is neither a profession nor a hobby; it’s a way of understanding, imagining and appreciating the things I see around.*

With the increasing capabilities of mobile devices, I see photography as a simple and a powerful means to share emotions, creativity and messages. That’s why Glostars is more than just a company where I work, it’s unbreakably connected to that deep me, who understands and expresses things visually.

>***Advice to those who want to achieve goals:***
*Be comfortable with failures after failures;*
*Your idea is never perfect on first go, you make it perfect over time;*
*Be the person who others can trust (team, customers, mentors, investors etc.);*
*Work on yourself to build skill sets and winning personality;*
*When things go wrong, don’t rush into conclusion, give it a day or two - you're going find a way;*
*Focus on the positive and achievements so far, not how things can go wrong.*

A self-portrait photograph is pretty much that: a portrait photo that an artist takes of themselves.

Sometimes we give the same definition to a “selfie”, but some professional photographers do not agree on that. A self-portrait is usually well thought and carefully prepared, while a selfie is usually taken by the nearest available gadget, such a smartphone or a compact camera, and captured quickly.

When trying to shoot a selfie or a self-portrait, you have to make sure to capture your real personality and not only your face. So keep reading and we will help you identify several important tips and techniques to take a perfect self-portrait or selfie.

The first self-portrait photo was taken in 1839 by photographer Robert Cornelius. The first “selfie” was taken using the same method of photography used by Louis Daguerre, the daguerreotype, one year before.

![Self portrait by Robert Cornelius, 1839.](https://glostars.blob.core.windows.net/blog-photos-13/Blog13_1_pic1.jpg)

*Self portrait by Robert Cornelius, 1839.*

Believe it or not, taking a selfie was not as easy as it is today. In order to be able to capture himself, Cornelius had to embrace in a long and exhausting process to prepare the camera for a single shot. Imagine having to sit down without moving for an entire minute.

>***Did you know?***
*Apparently, the left side of people’s faces looks better in photographs. Results of a study made by Wake Forest University indicate that the left side of our face shows a bigger amount of emotion, and we humans, distinguish it as more attractive.*

&nbsp;
### Tips to taking a perfect selfie

After some history and theory, it’s time to move to practice. Thereby, we suggest you following our advice to master selfie photography:

* Remember to have good lighting. This is very important. Natural lighting is the best option to have around when taking a selfie. So make sure you have a window nearby if you are indoors or simply go outside and enjoy the sun, and remember - even through the clouds, the sun is there, as well as the desired light.

* Smile and embrace natural expressions. Look up at the camera and think of something that genuinely makes you smile. That will create the look of genuine happiness going through your photo.

* Play with different angles. You don’t need to hold your camera straight in front of you. Try holding it from a side and experiment with captures from different angles.

* Check your background. Make sure you have an interesting background when you start snapping. Or, if you prefer, have a very simple one. Also, be careful of photo-bombers.

* Do not try so hard and remember to relax. The best selfie posture usually comes naturally to you.

*A man is taking a selfie on an Android phone during a walk on Lappeenranta University of Technology Campus.*

* Have fun with it. If you don’t enjoy the process, then it’s probably not worth it. Taking a selfie should not be, by any means, a stressful experience.

* Experiment with filters. Fortunately, there is a great range of different preset filters available by a variety of apps, including Glostars editing, that give a special touch to your self portrait.

* Hold your camera or phone slightly above your eyes and not too close to your face. Shooting a selfie from above and at the right distance helps to produce a better jawline.

* Do not limit yourself and take a lot of selfies. Keep experimenting, discovering and snapping away. As you keep going, you will feel more comfortable with the results and at the same time you will keep learning more and more about photography.

* If you wish to take a more professional approach for your self-portrait, then you have to consider using the proper equipment. Use a tripod and a remote, or a selfie stick. This will allow having your camera steady and being able to adjust at a larger distance from it before you take the shot.

Remember to take everything with proper moderation. Taking selfies can become an addictive hobby. Please make sure you seek help if you think you have a need to take selfies compulsively.

We hope these guidelines will help you capture the finest selfie and self-portrait photos. Let us know if you have any questions or comments about this or any other photography style. Join Glostars now and submit your best photos to our weekly theme contest.

Have you ever noticed those strange changes of colors in the sky every time the sun sets in the evening? That happens pretty much every day. What creates the colors of a sunset? Let’s explore and learn more.

First thing to understand is what makes sunsets so special. Without getting too technical about it and keeping it in a simple explanation, the Earth’s atmosphere filters the sunlight during the daytime.

When the sun is rising from the East and setting in the West, the light rays enter the atmosphere from a side where it takes longer to reach us, so the filtered light rays we see are mostly yellow, orange and red. At around noon, the sun is way up, the blue light spreads through the atmosphere giving the sky its color. Cool stuff, huh?

&nbsp;
### Best seasons for sunset photography

Well, now that we get those things clear, let’s try to answer a million dollar question. Is it true that during the fall the sunsets are more impressive?

![Sunset in a town in the South of Spain, San Lúcar de Barrameda, province of Cádiz.](https://glostars.blob.core.windows.net/blog-photos-14/Blog14_1_pic1.jpg)

The Earth's sky is naturally filled with small particles called aerosols. These particles work as filters to the sunlight coming through the atmosphere and spread it. During winter there are less aerosol particles in the air, and we are able to see colors in all their intensity. That’s why people perceive the skies above the Arctic to be so beautiful at sunset.

As winter solstice comes closer, the sun takes longer to set due to the fact that it takes a greater angle to set in relation to the horizon. So it means the following: sunset colors stay in the sky for longer periods of time closer to the winter solstice, which allows us to enjoy them longer as well.

&nbsp;
### Golden Hour

A golden hour is a time during the day when the sun emits light that is notably enjoyable to the eye. The Golden Hour can refer to the position of the sun in relation to the horizon.

When does the golden hour happen exactly? The Golden Hour takes place during the first hour after sunrise and the last hour right before the sun sets. During this time the light emitted from the sun appears of natural warmth which is ideal for photography.

&nbsp;
### Best equipment

It is fair to say that any digital camera offering manual control over the settings should be able to capture very nice sunset photos. When it comes to sunset pictures, an important thing to consider in a camera is its dynamic range. Dynamic range is the amount of detail that can be captured by a camera within light and dark areas.

The best camera settings:

* Aperture: a higher aperture number will allow the camera to get a larger depth of field and keep much of the scene in focus.

* ISO: keep a low ISO to avoid grainy captures.

* White Balance: try to experiment with this option since it can give you different results of colored sunsets.

* Focus: if you experience difficulties with the auto focus of your camera due to the lighting conditions, then this is a good time to switch to manual focus.

* Exposure: try lowering the exposure for sunset pictures, as this will prevent the shots from getting blown by sunlight.

* RAW: There are a lot of details to capture in a sunset, so shooting in RAW gives more chances of capturing them.

Wide angle lenses are very popular for sunset photography. They allow capturing a wider scenery. On the other hand, a telephoto lens will do the opposite. It can make the sun look larger and help create an effect as if you focus on a specific part of the scene.

Try using a tripod. Having a camera perfectly still will help get the best captures, especially if you are shooting with longer shutter speed or longer focal lengths. Sunset photography means you have to use slower shutter speeds. This is because lower light and smaller apertures are usually involved.

Filters can come in handy for sunset photography. A graduated neutral density (GND) filter increases the dynamic range in a sunset photo. It darkens the sky and allows a camera to receive enough light so the landscape can be properly exposed.

### Tips for perfect sunset photos

Planning is key! Make sure you schedule your photo shoots ahead of time. We advise you to think about the location. Are you more into an urban or rural scene? Ground or aerial shot? Will there be water at the scene? You will have to answer a lot of questions in order to make a plan and execute it smoothly. Also, you can try using a Golden Hour calculator to avoid wasting time.

Expert photographers recommend being in the place at least half an hour before the sun starts to set. Make sure you have all the equipment you may need. Check the section above to know the recommended equipment and settings for sunset photography.

Knowing the weather behavior is important. Sunsets can be very different depending on weather conditions. So explore all possibilities.

Make sure your lenses are clean. It is very common that the equipment for landscape photography gets dirty over use. Lenses are, after all, the easiest part to get dirty due to exposure.

Adjust proper camera settings. There is no strict rule on how to proceed with the settings, but we’ve already mentioned those earlier, just review.

Use clouds. Check if there will be clouds at the scene. They can add special effects and a story to the picture. Clouds have the capability to add new colors and silhouettes in the sky.

Be patient and stay after the sunset. Try to use the colors changing in the sky after the sun has set. You might find amazing sights to capture!

It’s getting cold in here. Or not. Depends on where you spend your winter.

But Glostars is originally from Finland, a place famous for it being the happiest country in the world, also people who absolutely love coffee, sauna and metal music. What’s also known about Finland is that it has Lapland, the cold region with Santa Claus, reindeers and tons of snow. So summing up, Finnish winter is most likely cold and snowy and people get warm doing things that make them happy. For instance, they go outside in nature and take beautiful photos.

How do they do it over there during winter season? Let’s explore together and have a magical and warm winter photoshoot. We’ve generated 5 tips to make your winter photography safe and fun.

&nbsp;
### #1 Adjust Photo Settings

Well, capture settings are mostly up to the photographer, but still make sure you make suitable adjustments when shooting snowy landscapes.

It’s all about how bright it is. When the day is dazzling and there is a lot of sun and snow around, you might need to adjust exposure settings to be able to capture the image just right. Try this:

* Low ISO;

* Fast shutter speed which makes it easy to capture snowflakes in the air;

* Low exposure.

The aperture depends on what you want to capture. Landscape should be captured at a small aperture (large number), while a specific object with a blurry background requires a big aperture (small number). 

And if you take winter photos in a dull light use the higher ISO, rather than slower shutter speed. You might also have a higher exposure, while keeping the aperture the same as in the bright light photoshoot.

### #2 Keep Inner & Camera Batteries Warm

Look out for those batteries. It is important to keep your camera batteries warm during long sessions in cold weather. Exposing those to very low temperatures will reduce their charge and limit the amount of photos you will be able to take in a session.

Most importantly, don’t forget to keep yourself warm. Of course, it depends a lot on the location you are, but during the winter season in the northern hemisphere there can be freezing temperature and cold strong winds to face when photo shooting outdoors.

You might want to consider wearing several layers of clothes, including a winter coat, thick gloves, as well as boots. Without the proper gear it can be very difficult to sustain long sessions of photography during harsh conditions. So please, take care of yourself!

&nbsp;
### #3 Beware of Foggy Shots

Be careful with the moisture in your lens. Seriously, as it can cause undesired effects not only to your photos, but also your device.

If you try to change places - going from outdoors at freezing temperatures indoors in a warmer environment - the lens of your camera can become foggy really quickly due to moisture around it. In order to avoid this, you can simply cover your camera and lens in a camera bag before changing locations.

&nbsp;
### #4 Get The Right Gear

One thing is to take photos indoors at a comfortable environment temperature and minimum amount of clothes on you. Something completely different is to shoot outdoors when it’s lovely, yet freezing.

It is imperative that you consider wearing the right type of clothes if you plan on doing a long session of photography. Since your hands are very important for taking photos you have to make sure you wear photo-friendly gloves. It will be very helpful for you to be able to capture photos without having to take off your gloves everytime you need to take a click.

Getting a snow/rain cover is also a good idea if you plan to capture snow falls or general snowy sceneries. Keeping your equipment dry can save a lot of money during later repairs.

&nbsp;
### #5 Protect Your Camera

The best way to dry your camera if it gets wet is to cover it with a dry towel. Let it stay covered for a couple of hours. The towel must be able to absorb the moisture by itself. It is not recommended to try to wipe the humidity from the camera since you might be able to push it inside and put the electronic components at risk.

These would be top five advice on how to manage your photography during cold winter days and nights. We hope they help you have a great photo session this winter.

Look forward to seeing your beautiful captures on Glostars!
